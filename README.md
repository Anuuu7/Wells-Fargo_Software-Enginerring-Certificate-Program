Project Description
This project is a Spring Boot application where I have implemented a data model based on the given requirements. The model includes entity classes annotated with @Entity, proper relationships between entities (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne, etc.), and database configurations using Spring Data JPA. 

Each entity follows best practices, including:
1. Auto-generated primary keys (@Id @GeneratedValue).
2. Proper annotations for columns and relationships.
3. Getters, setters, and constructors for initialization.
This project is structured to work with a relational database and serves as the foundation for building a scalable backend system. ðŸš€
